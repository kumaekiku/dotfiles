# A "MINI"MAL WORK"FLOW" PDE
---
## Introduction
Welcome to my Personal Development Environment (PDE).
This was originaly made to fufil my desire to help people have a better start on their journey.

Tool that i use (each should have it own blog):
- Text editor -> Neovim
- Terminal multiplexer -> Tmux
- Terminal emulator -> Wezterm (waiting for Ghostty) on UNIX system or Window Terminal on Window
- Terminal shell -> ZSH being more feature than bash but less than fish however most of the time it is now supported on docker image

Thinking of switching to use NixOs for the reproducability, some reminder:
- Swtiched to lsp-zero from mason (removing Mason completely) since NixOS did not like how Mason handles binary downloading, and it was honestly more of a headache in general

My goal when it comes to configure these tools are:
- As minimal as possible (prevent distraction)
- If im not using it then it is useless (never add it in)
- Reproducable anywhere you want as long as that machine has git intalled (which mostly does)

**This is just my own configuration, it is recommened that you read every file carefully and make a version of your own**
